## Welcome

Welcome to my coding cookbook. Within this repository, I'll be doing my best to compile all the bits of code I find useful in the various projects I'm working on. If you find any of it useful, or perhaps find any mistakes, feel free to let me know. I'm always keen to learn if there are better ways to go about doing something, and improve my coding skills. :)
